<p>I have loved books for as long as I can remember. Growing up in rural Virginia, books were a way to visit other lives and other worlds. As an itty-bitty I adored The Little Match Girl and asked my father to read it to me again and again. As I got older, and I could read to myself, I discovered an entire magical world of books. I read whatever I could get my hands on and loved everything from the books of Jane Austen and the Bronte sisters, to the horror of Christopher Pike, to the magic of Anne McCaffrey and her dragons of Pern. I remember waking up on Saturday mornings, excited to go to the library and get new books. When I got home with my books, I’d stack them in the order I intended to read them (usually alphabetical by author).</p>

<p>I started writing when I was ten. I wrote a poem on the school bus and, for a little while, thought I would be a poet. As I got older, though, I realized that my poetry was not very good, and I started writing stories. I think my first story involved a pirate and a damsel in distress. I wrote fantasy for a while, then tried to write something more literary, before switching back to my first love, fantasy.</p>

<p>I earned a degree in English from the University of Virginia. I had worked retail jobs while I was in school and, after I graduated, I remained in the retail field because I felt it would allow me more time to write. I think I spent more time in the gym than I did writing, but I did manage to almost finish one book before putting it in the proverbial trunk and starting another. In 2001, I went backpacking around Europe for six weeks. I saw a lot of really amazing places and had a lot of fun, while learning that I am probably more of a hotel and suitcase than hostel and backpack kind of girl. When I got back from Europe, I moved to Colorado and lived the ski bum lifestyle for two seasons. I fell in love with the Rocky Mountains and with snow so deep I could disappear in it.</p>

<p>I moved back to Virginia in 2003, and met my husband several months later. He has helped me to settle down and discover the focus and the discipline I needed to finish the book I’d been working on, what is now The Reaping. His belief in me and my abilities has never faltered, and he convinced me to self-publish my first book in February of 2014.</p>

<p>I publish Romance as Katharine Sadler and Fantasy as K. G. Sadler.</p>
